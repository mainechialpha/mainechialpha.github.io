With an entire week off from classes, we see an incredible opportunity to spend Spring Break reaching our "Judea." Our first ever trip headed to Worcester, MA to love a community through a connection with a local church. For more information on how to get involved, send us an email at [umainechialpha@gmail.com](mailto:umainechialpha@gmail.com) or contact a staff member!
