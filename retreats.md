Fall Retreat--bringing new people together, growing connections as we learn about God, time away, creative family fun together. Here's what we see out of these experiences: this is a place where we meet God and we are changed through this--sometimes in big ways, sometimes in smaller (different word) ways. This is all UMaine, encountering God in new ways.

Winter Retreat--We've had time as established family and now we're going away and devoting time again to hearing from God with the bigger extended family. Still fun. Still worshipful. Different setting.
