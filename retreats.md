Fall Retreat--We're bringing new people together, growing connections as we learn about God, getting time away, and having creative family fun together. Here's what we see out of these experiences: this is a place where we meet God and we are changed through because of it--sometimes in big ways, sometimes in smaller and more pointed ways. Everyone here will be from the University of Maine!

Winter Retreat--We've had time as established family and now we're going away and devoting time again to hearing from God. This time, we're with the bigger extended family from the rest of Northern New England. More fun, more worship, new setting.
