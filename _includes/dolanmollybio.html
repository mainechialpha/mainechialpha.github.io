<p>Dolan Ellis hails from the state of California and has a degree in Music Education. He's always down for a challenge, whether it's the Zimmerman, eating an orange with its peel still on, or nearly any board game. He is compassionate, quick to encourage, and will always have your back--if you're looking for a brother, look no further than Dolan. He loves bread, local restaurants, all things peanut butter and ice cream, is an avid chess player, and enjoys taking care of his new home. Not only is he most talented and passionate drummer you'll ever meet, but he also writes worship songs and has the entire book of James memorized. He lovesdiscipleship and is always challenging his guys to live in more truth. </p>

<p>Molly Ellis is a southern belle at heart, born and raised in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and has her master's degree in Speech Therapy. If there is any talent or skill you're interested in, Molly can probably teach you--she is a professional baker, sewer, creator, painter, singer, reupholster-er, snow shoveler… there's nothing she can't do. She loves her girls fiercely and isn't afraid to challenge you to keep you from getting second best. She will always drink iced coffee over hot coffee… even when it's -12 outside. She loves classic literature and she knows more nursery rhymes than Mother Goose. She always makes her friends feel special, is incredibly wise, is quick to remind others of truth, and is good at finding new solutions.</p>

<p>Together, Dolan and Molly go on lots of adventures (Dolan loves surprising Molly with dates), they are trivia fiends, and love creating stories and songs about everything. They have a passion for worship, both musically and in our lives. Their home is open and warm and welcoming, and everyone they meet becomes a part of their family. </p>
