<p>Mac Holderfield was born and raised in Rison, Arkansas, and graduated with a degree in Biology. He is a hardworking, thoughtful, adventurous guy who loves couscous and is eagerly longing to see a moose. He will alwayssit down and play a game of Risk with you, and one of his favorite pastimes is bouldering with his best pal, Dolan. He is excellent at communicating big dreams and vision, has a passion to see young men risen up into true men of God, and lives sacrificially for his friends. He is quick to encourage and affirm others and notices the little things, whether it's making sure the projector screen looks professional or marveling over a leopard frog.</p>

<p>Mindi Holderfield comes from Springdale, Arkansas, and has a degree in Religious Studies. She is a horse whisperer, is the best at figuring out riddles and the punchlines to jokes, and was once crowned a knot-tying champion. (Really. Ask her about it.) She loves reading and theological discussions, learning about God through the stories in the Bible, and in turn, sharing her life story with the girls she disciples. She loves to serve, is fun, passionate, patient, thoughtful, and will probably beat you at Time's Up. She may get the gigglesâ€¦ and not be able to un-get them.</p>

<p>Together, they're incredible. Incredible parents to Gabriel and Annagale, incredible spouses to each other, and an incredible team. They love coffee (Mindi drinks it hotter than anyone you've ever met) and are passionate to see the restoration of healthy dating relationships and marriage. They find a lot of life in serving each other, and it overflows into the way they love those around them. If you need to memorize "If You Give a Moose a Muffin," or "Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?" they're your people.</p>
