![Large Group Worship]({{ site.url }}/images/retreat3.jpg)

Our large group worship service is like a family reunion every week. You'll be challenged to be right where you're at with God in a roomful of people--to not put on a face, to have real conversations, to be genuine. We don't sing at God, we worship, because there is a freedom that comes in worshiping God and taking our eyes off ourselves. You'll be entrusted with the Word of God in a deeper way each time you come. Just like in D-Group, we don't want to know more of the Word but live the same, so each week you'll be challenged to think through what it looks like to put action behind knowledge. Anybody who wants to take the challenge can take it. To walk into Large Group is to come home--this may not look like the home you've known, but this is what coming home feels like.

With a few exceptions, our Large Group Worship service is held at 7:30 PM on Monday nights, and we'll be in the Bangor Room in the Union! Our first service will be held on September 13. We're excited to see you there!
