Romans 10:14-15 proclaims, "How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: 'How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!'"


Through giving to our ministry as a whole, you're equipping the staff and students to proclaim the Gospel on the University of Maine and the surrounding area.


Through giving to Project 222, you're sending students overseas to proclaim the Gospel so that others will know who to call on.


We are so grateful for those who have sent and who continue to send us.

- If giving to a specific student going on Project, please type their name in the "special instructions to the seller" box.
