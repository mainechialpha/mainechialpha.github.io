    Mac Holderfield was born and raised in Rison, Arkansas, and graduated with a degree in Biology. He is a hardworking, thoughtful, adventurous guy who loves couscous and is eagerly longing to see a moose. He will alwayssit down and play a game of Risk with you, and one of his favorite pastimes is bouldering with his best pal, Dolan. He is excellent at communicating big dreams and vision, has a passion to see young men risen up into true men of God, and lives sacrificially for his friends. He is quick to encourage and affirm others and notices the little things, whether it's making sure the projector screen looks professional or marveling over a leopard frog.
    <br/><br/>Mindi Holderfield comes from Springdale, Arkansas, and has a degree in Religious Studies. She is a horse whisperer, is the best at figuring out riddles and the punchlines to jokes, and was once crowned a knot-tying champion. (Really. Ask her about it.) She loves reading and theological discussions, learning about God through the stories in the Bible, and in turn, sharing her life story with the girls she disciples. She loves to serve, is fun, passionate, patient, thoughtful, and will probably beat you at Time's Up. She may get the giggles… and not be able to un-get them.
    <br/><br/>Together, they're incredible. Incredible parents to Gabriel and Annagale, incredible spouses to each other, and an incredible team. They love coffee (Mindi drinks it hotter than anyone you've ever met) and are passionate to see the restoration of healthy dating relationships and marriage. They find a lot of life in serving each other, and it overflows into the way they love those around them. If you need to memorize "If You Give a Moose a Muffin," or "Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?" they're your people.

He lovesdiscipleship and is always challenging his guys to live in more truth.
    <br/><br/>Molly Ellis is a southern belle at heart, born and raised in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and has her master's degree in Speech Therapy. If there is any talent or skill you're interested in, Molly can probably teach you--she is a professional baker, sewer, creator, painter, singer, reupholster-er, snow shoveler… there's nothing she can't do. She loves her girls fiercely and isn't afraid to challenge you to keep you from getting second best. She will always drink iced coffee over hot coffee… even when it's -12 outside. She loves classic literature and she knows more nursery rhymes than Mother Goose. She always makes her friends feel special, is incredibly wise, is quick to remind others of truth, and is good at finding new solutions.
    <br/><br/>Together, Dolan and Molly go on lots of adventures (Dolan loves surprising Molly with dates), they are trivia fiends, and love creating stories and songs about everything. They have a passion for worship, both musically and in our lives. Their home is open and warm and welcoming, and everyone they meet becomes a part of their family.
