    Mac and Mindi Holderfield hail from the great state of Arkansas! Mac grew up in Rison and has grown into a hardworking, thoughtful, adventurous guy who loves couscous and is eagerly longing to see a moose. He’s an excellent director for Chi Alpha and he is excellent at communicating big dreams and vision. He lives sacrificially for his friends and always notices the little things, whether it's making sure the projector screen looks professional or marveling over a leopard frog. Mindi is originally from Springdale, is the best at figuring out punchlines to jokes and riddles, and was once crowned a knot-tying champion. (Really!) She loves reading and theological discussions, learning about God through the stories in the Bible, and in turn, sharing her life story with the girls she disciples. Together, Mac and Mindi are incredible: incredible parents to their two children, incredible spouses to each other, and an incredible team. They find a lot of life in serving each other, and it overflows into the way they love those around them.

    Josh and Leah are the latest dynamic duo to roll up in Maine! They completed their undergraduate degrees and Chi Alpha internships at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Josh is originally from Haynesville, Louisiana while Leah was born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma! Their paths crossed when they both majored in ASL Interpreting, and now in their life together they give Chip and Joanna a run for their money with refurnishing and making things new. Josh loves everything gray… probably because of his last name, and would prefer any food with Tony's seasoning. Leah loves alpacas a lot and has the best laugh of anyone you'll ever meet! They are movie connoisseurs, pun masters, and are avid board gamers and puzzlers. They create family with the people around them and don’t let people slip through the cracks.
