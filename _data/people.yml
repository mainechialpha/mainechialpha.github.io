    Mac and Mindi Holderfield hail from the great state of Arkansas! Mac grew up in Rison and has grown into a hardworking, thoughtful, adventurous guy who loves couscous and is eagerly longing to see a moose. He’s an excellent director for Chi Alpha and he is excellent at communicating big dreams and vision. He lives sacrificially for his friends and always notices the little things, whether it's making sure the projector screen looks professional or marveling over a leopard frog. Mindi is originally from Springdale, is the best at figuring out punchlines to jokes and riddles, and was once crowned a knot-tying champion. (Really!) She loves reading and theological discussions, learning about God through the stories in the Bible, and in turn, sharing her life story with the girls she disciples. Together, Mac and Mindi are incredible: incredible parents to their three children, incredible spouses to each other, and an incredible team. They find a lot of life in serving each other, and it overflows into the way they love those around them.

    Chelsey is a New England native and got her bachelor's in Middle Level Education from the University of Vermont. From mud runs to triathlons, lacrosse to kickball, she's always down for a good time. Chelsey’s compassionate, reliable, and loves to serve others. If she's not outside, you might find her crocheting, happily pouring over a spreadsheet, discussing her unexplainable love for armadillos, or making heart eyes at her new husband, Seth. Seth is from Farmington, Arkansas and got his bachelor’s in Business Administration at Arkansas State University. He is the newest member of the team! Seth’s happy place is in the kitchen trying out a new recipe, or sitting in a comfy chair, diving into a new book and drinking a great cup of coffee. He loves learning and has a passion to teach and share what he learns with others. Together, the Schaders love opportunities to share their new home with others. (Dinner and games, anyone?!) They are passionate about seeing our students live life to the fullest with God by pursing the amazing adventure of knowing Him and bringing others along with them.

    Josh and Leah visted Maine twice (during the winter months, we might add) and decided it had to be home! They completed their undergraduate degrees and Chi Alpha internships at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Josh is originally from Haynesville, Louisiana while Leah was born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma! Their paths crossed when they both majored in ASL Interpreting, and now in their life together they give Chip and Joanna a run for their money with refurnishing and making things new. Josh loves everything gray… probably because of his last name, and would prefer any food with Tony's seasoning. Leah loves alpacas a lot and has the best laugh of anyone you'll ever meet! They are movie connoisseurs, pun masters, and are avid board gamers and puzzlers. They create family with everyone around them and don’t let people slip through the cracks.
