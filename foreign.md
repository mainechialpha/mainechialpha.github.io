Project 222

Why has Chi Alpha decided that it’s a good idea to take a group of university students overseas? In Jesus’ final address to the disciples, He told them to take the Gospel to all nations, beginning “in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” (Acts 1:8)

As a ministry, we take this commission seriously. We are continually reaching out to our local campus—our Jerusalem—to the surrounding community—our Judea—and to international students on campus—our Samaria. Project is our response to the standing call to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth.

In considering where we will go for Project, we look for places of desperate need. In Haiti, suffering is rooted in oppressive spiritual darkness, perversion, and poverty. Since 2006, through partnerships with long-term missionaries, we have been working to bring life-changing education and revelation to people who are desperately lost, but loved by the Lord.
