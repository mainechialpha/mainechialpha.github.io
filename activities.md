### Stroll to the Nest

##### Sunday, September 13 @ 1PM

Passeggiata, or promenade, is a popular pastime throughout Italy. This term means to go on a stroll. Often, walking is equated to staying fit or moving from point A to B. In Italy, it is more of a leisurely stroll in the company of family and friends - to see and be seen. Come take a stroll with us from the steps of Fogler to the Nest in downtown Orono. Just enjoy the walk or have a drink or bite when we get to the Nest.
