### Wouldn't you know it, this year is strange!!

We normally have a big ol' rollout of official events that we plan and host every year, but with a shorter semester and more restrictions, we're getting our creative juices flowing. The great thing about family is that we have plenty of impromptu events, from hiking to ultimate frisbee to worship nights to dinners at Buffalo Wild Wings. Check our Facebook or Instagram for happenings, and if you want to be added to our GroupMe for real-time updates, contact someone on staff so we can get you connected!
