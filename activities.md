### Mark on the Mall

#### Saturday, September 5 @ 10AM

⋅⋅⋅As followers of Jesus, we believe the Bible is God’s life manual for humanity. This fall, several Chi Alphans are learning from the book of Mark; this is an opportunity to hear a dramatized version read together. If you’ve ever wondered what do “those Christians” mean by the gospel, or wondered about the real story of the life of Jesus, then come hear for yourself. The goal here will not be to draw out discussion or q&a. It is rather an opportunity to relax, listen, and consider in the company of friends. Pull up a seat!

⋅⋅⋅Aim to bring a camp chair, blanket, or something else for seating. Listening time is 1 hr 33 min.

### Stroll to the Nest

#### Sunday, September 13 @ 1PM

Passeggiata, or promenade, is a popular pastime throughout Italy. This term means to go on a stroll. Often, walking is equated to staying fit or moving from point A to B. In Italy, it is more of a leisurely stroll in the company of family and friends - to see and be seen. Come take a stroll with us from the steps of Fogler to the Nest in downtown Orono. Just enjoy the walk or have a drink or bite when we get to the Nest.
