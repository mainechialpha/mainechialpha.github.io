#### Is Chi Alpha a fraternity/sorority?

Nope! But if you’re looking for brother or sisterhood, look no further. Our name comes from the Greek for Christ's ambassadors--X (Chi) A (Alpha).

#### Where do you meet?

In the Bangor Room in the Union (room 232!) on Monday nights at 7:30PM. We also have weekly small groups—more on that below!

#### What do I do if I'm interested?

Just show up! Our large and small groups are open to any student who'd like to be there. No background necessary. If you have questions you want answered ahead of time, feel free to email any of our staff personally or our group email, umainechialpha@gmail.com!

#### Do you have small groups?

We do indeed! They’re called discipleship groups (d-groups, for short) and we have various times and locations weekly on and off campus. Head on over to the “Connect” tab or check out our Facebook page!
