#### Is Chi Alpha a fraternity/sorority?

Nope! But if you’re looking for brother or sisterhood, look no further. Our name comes from the Greek for Christ's ambassadors--X (Chi) A (Alpha).

#### Where do you meet?

Our large group meets primarily in the Bangor Room of the Student Union each Monday night at 7:30. We also have weekly small groups.

#### What do I do if I'm interested?

Just show up! Our large and small groups are open to any student who'd like to be there. No background necessary.

#### Do you have small groups?

We do indeed! They’re called discipleship groups (d-groups, for short) and we have various times and locations weekly on campus.
